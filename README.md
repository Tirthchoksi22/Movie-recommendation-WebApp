# Movie-recommended system
## Overview
This project is a movie recommendation system that utilizes the TMDB (The Movie Database) dataset and cosine similarity technique to provide personalized movie recommendations to users. By analyzing user preferences and movie features, the system suggests movies that are similar to those the user has liked or rated positively.

## Dataset
The TMDB dataset is used as the source of movie data for this recommendation system. The dataset contains information about movies, including their titles, genres, cast, crew, and user ratings.

Dataset source: TMDB 5000 Movie Dataset

## System Architecture
The recommendation system is built using Python and relies on several libraries for data processing, analysis, and recommendation generation:

pandas: For data manipulation and preprocessing.
scikit-learn: For computing cosine similarity between movie vectors.
NumPy: For numerical operations.
matplotlib/seaborn: For data visualization (optional).
Implementation
Data Preprocessing: The TMDB dataset is loaded and preprocessed to extract relevant features such as movie genres, cast, crew, and user ratings.

Feature Engineering: Movie features are transformed into numerical vectors using techniques like one-hot encoding or TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency) for categorical features like genres and cast.

Cosine Similarity Calculation: Cosine similarity is computed between movie vectors to measure the similarity between movies. Movies with higher cosine similarity scores are considered more similar to each other.

User Preference Analysis: User preferences are captured through their interactions with movies, such as ratings or likes. Based on the movies the user has positively rated, the system identifies similar movies using cosine similarity scores.

Recommendation Generation: Finally, the system generates personalized movie recommendations for the user based on the similarity scores of movies they have liked or rated positively.

## Usage
To use the recommendation system:

Download the TMDB dataset from the provided source.
Install the required Python libraries mentioned in the requirements.txt file.
Run the main script to preprocess the data, calculate cosine similarity, and generate recommendations.
Input user preferences (liked or positively rated movies) to receive personalized recommendations.

## Future Improvements
Incorporate collaborative filtering techniques to enhance recommendation quality.
Implement a user interface for better user interaction and experience.
Experiment with different similarity metrics and feature engineering techniques to improve recommendation accuracy.
